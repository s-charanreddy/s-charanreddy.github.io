## Hello World

I have been thinking of setting up a personal site from quite sometime,
but couldn't be do so.

I suck at writing, I want to improve my writing, one way is to start
writing what ever that comes to my mind without bothering about who
will think of what.

I hope this will be starting of something new, I will write my learnings
at work, personal stuff and what I want to share.......

I am about to complete one year as a professional software engineer in couple
of days, I will write out all the things that I learned in past 1 year.

See you all Soonnnnnnn.........
